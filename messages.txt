ERROR MESSAGE MEANINGS:

1 : Cannot find a critical temperature.
2 : Cannot find where \phi=0 swaps from local minima to maxima.
3 : All tested actions are 0
4 : Less than 3 tested actions are found. May need to decrease stepsize.
5 : No I found greater than 0.34 therefore no transition before BBN.
6 : ValueError trying to find I(T)=0.34.
7 : Could not find a nucleation temperature. Somehow.
8 : Should never happen. Somehow evaded all 'if's'
15 : Potential does not have 3 real solutions.
16 : Potential has failed to build. Usually means dressed mass calculation is poorly convergent.
17 : S_3/T is not monotonically increasing with T, data too noisy.
18 : Tc is ten times Tn, which is very suspicious.
