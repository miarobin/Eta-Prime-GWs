## A Project for Computing Gravitational Wave Signals for the Eta Prime.

# A To Do List:
1. Would like to include F = 4 (F = Number of flavours). The correct effective particle masses ect can be found in 1904.10967.
2. Make N arbitrary (N = Number of colours). The conditions for a 1OPT for a given N and F are found in 1810.04360 for the original linear sigma model potential.
  2a. But we also need to check what the conditions are for a 1st order phase transition for the new potential in 2307.04809.
3. Have a look at implementing DRalgo in Mathematica https://github.com/DR-algo/DRalgo/tree/main.

# How to Download:
You'll want a python/conda virtual environment in python 3.X with cosmotransitions (pip install cosmotransitions), scipy, numpy, matplotlib, ...
Then in theory it should just run.
