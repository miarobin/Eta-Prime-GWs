ERROR MESSAGE MEANINGS:

1 : Cannot find a critical temperature.
2 : Cannot find where \phi=0 swaps from local minima to maxima.
3 : All tested actions are 0
4 : Less than 3 tested actions are found. May need to decrease stepsize.
5 : No I found greater than 0.34 therefore no transition <--- This is fine BTW, just no transition before BBN. I think.
6 : ValueError trying to find I(T)=0.34.
7 : Could not find a nucleation temperature. Somehow.
8 : Should never happen. Somehow evaded all 'if's'
15 : Potential does not have 3 real solutions.
